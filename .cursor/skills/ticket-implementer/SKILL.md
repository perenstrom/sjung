name: ticket-implementer
description: Picks a Todo ticket from the Sjung Linear project and implements it end-to-end: creates a git branch, writes the code following project conventions, verifies with lints and build, commits, and moves the ticket to In Review. Use when the user wants to implement a ticket, work on a ticket, or says "pick a ticket and implement it".

# Ticket Implementer

## Step 1: Discover Linear context

Use the `plugin-linear-linear` MCP server to look up:
- The team: `list_teams`
- Status IDs for "Todo", "In Progress", and "In Review": `list_issue_statuses` (requires `team`)
- Confirm project "Sjung" exists: `list_projects`

Run these lookups upfront; reuse the results for the rest of the session.

## Step 2: Pick a ticket

- Call `list_issues` with `project: "Sjung"`, `state: "Todo"`, `orderBy: "createdAt"`.
- Select: highest priority first; oldest as tiebreaker.
- Call `get_issue` to fetch full details (implementation plan, decisions, acceptance criteria, hints).
- Present the ticket title and description to the user, then confirm before proceeding.
- If the user wants a different one, show the full list and let them choose by number or title.

## Step 3: Move to In Progress

- Call `save_issue` with `id` and `state: "In Progress"`.

## Step 4: Create a git branch

- Derive a branch name: lowercase ticket identifier + slugified title, e.g. `sj-42/add-sheet-music-filtering`.
- Run `git checkout -b <branch>`.

## Step 5: Explore the codebase

Before writing any code, read all files referenced in the ticket hints and explore related areas using the codebase reference below. Understanding the context is essential for correct, convention-following code.

## Step 6: Implement the ticket

Work through the ticket's implementation plan and key decisions. Check off each acceptance criterion as you go.

Follow these project conventions:

**Server actions** (`app/actions/*.ts`):
- Top-of-file `"use server"` directive
- Prisma via `@/lib/prisma`; scope reads with `where: { groupId: DEFAULT_GROUP_ID }` from `@/lib/context`
- Mutations take `FormData`, validate required fields, throw Swedish errors on bad input
- Call `revalidatePath` after writes

**Pages** (`app/<segment>/page.tsx`):
- Async server components by default
- Data loading via functions from `app/actions/`
- Register new routes in `components/AppSidebar.tsx` if the page needs sidebar nav

**Interactive UI** (`components/*.tsx`):
- `"use client"` directive
- Radix/shadcn `Dialog` wrapping a `form` with `action={async (formData) => ...}` forwarding to a server action
- UI strings in Swedish
- Use roles from `lib/roles.ts` (`ROLES` constant, `Role` type) for credit-related features

**Schema changes** (when required):
- Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name <descriptive-name>`
- Client is regenerated automatically (output: `app/generated/prisma`)

## Step 7: Verify

1. Run `ReadLints` on all edited files; fix any errors introduced by your changes.
2. Run `nvm use 22 && npx next build` and confirm it succeeds.
3. If the build fails, fix the issues and re-verify.

## Step 8: Commit in small increments and update ticket

- Do **not** bundle the whole implementation into one large commit unless the change is truly tiny.
- Split work into small, logical commits (for example: schema change, server action update, UI update, tests/docs), each leaving the branch in a coherent state.
- Keep each commit message clear and specific, and reference the ticket in every commit, e.g.:
  - `SJ-42: Add composer filter to sheet music query`
  - `SJ-42: Add composer filter controls to Noter page`
- Before the final status change, ensure commits read as a clean story and are easy to review.
- Call `save_issue` with `id` and `state: "In Review"` after the implementation is committed.
